Cutting The Multiverse: Scene Breakdowns from Everything Everywhere All At Once | Premiere Pro;0:05:13;2022-05-12;19833;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WY_-2JA3wpg;"Making a feature film is daunting under the best of circumstances. But factor in the pandemic, lockdown and a far-flung roster of filmmaking talent, and it can seem almost impossible. Meet a key player behind the new film Everything Everywhere All At Once, a hilarious and big-hearted sci-fi action adventure about an exhausted Chinese-American woman who is swept up in an insane adventure where she alone can save the world. Hear from Paul Rogers, editor, as he shares how they created the film through cloud-based collaboration and shared technology, including Adobe Premiere Pro and Frame.io. To borrow a line from the film: “The universe is so much bigger than you realize;” the making of Everything Everywhere All At Once proves that sentiment to be true with its filmmaking teams and talent collaborating around the world.

Music Videos | Adobe Video Community Meet-up;0:38:16;2022-02-25;113815;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyCM92JMD_s;"Animated music videos have been created since the beginning of music-based film and video production.

Konee Rok, an award-winning filmmaker known for his work with many popular artists in hip-hop, rap, and breakdancing culture. He’s a director, documentarian and animator. And he created the distinct animated visuals for DJ Aktive’s music video “The City” ft. Common, Jazzy Jeff, Freeway, and Bri Steves. https://koneerok.com/ In the City music video he created with PS and CH: https://vimeo.com/koneerok/commonthecity

Over the years he’s worked on a variety of projects including the independent animated film, The Realm Beyond Reason. More recently he collaborated with Pat Moriarity on the animated music video for the Replacements “Shutup” music video. More about the “Shutup” music video: https://www.provideocoalition.com/the... 

Jim Tews

He's been seen on FX, NBC, SeeSo, and TBS. His recent comedy album “I Was In Band” debuted at #3 on the iTunes comedy charts. He has also realized animation is a great way to bring his ideas to life and to tell the stories he wanted to tell, without setting up lights and camera equipment. Jim created a video for Weezer, which was endorsed by the band. His other work includes characters, commercial parodies, and standup. Weezer, “Happy Hour”, music video: https://youtu.be/OJO5E9wpF3M

Join co-editors Giselle Murillo (Modern Family, New Girl) and Kelly Lyon (Saturday Night Live, John Mulaney Kid Gorgeous Live at Radio City, Portlandia) to learn how they cut Amazon Prime's Yearly Departed while working remotely during the pandemic.

Yearly Departed is a series of eulogies for the year 2020. After a year of societal upheaval, plague, murder hornets and banana bread, Yearly Departed gives 2020 the huge send-off it deserves, from 7 of the world’s funniest women, who were each fimed separately.

They will discuss the challenges and solutions for making the comedians feel like they were in the same room together, all while working with a post team, director and producers scattered across the country."

Art of Editing: Connecting through Creativity - Adobe Video at Sundance Film Festival 2021;0:45:30;2021-01-29;70486;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAePvMDz2F4;"Join the filmmakers behind two of Sundance's most anticipated features – Daryl Wein (co-director, co-writer, co-producer, co-DP and co-editor, How It Ends) and Lam Nguyen (editor, R#J) - as they talk about the art of editing and the powerful stories that capture the uniqueness of our time -- from one woman's journey on the last day of the world to a Romeo and Juliet romance told entirely through phone screens. Adobe Principal Product Marketing Manager Meagan Keane sits down with Daryl and Lam to discuss the challenges and opportunities created by remote filmmaking, the tools that got them through, and the important role that creativity plays in bringing people together during a time when connection is more important than ever.

How it Ends, starring Zoe Lister-Jones, Cailee Spaeny, Olivia Wilde, Fred Armisen, Helen Hunt, and Lamorne Morris, debuts in the Premieres section on January 29.

R#J, starring Francesca Noel and Camaron Engels, debuts in the NEXT section on January 30.

We're giving you an easier way to discover, add, and browse anything you could need to level-up your video edits.

Beyond Graphics and Audio: Transitions, Pan and Zoom, Auto Reframe for Everyone Available on all platforms. You asked, we delivered! Transitions can create drama, set the stage for a new direction, and up-level video content overall. Which is why we’ve launched three new transitions: Push, Slide, and Wipe. With more creative freedom than ever, you can choose to implement them from the top, bottom, left, or right-hand side of the screen.

Plus, Pan and Zoom and Auto Reframe are now available on all platforms. Put your camera roll to work telling your story and bring your still photos and video clips to life! Pan and Zoom can be applied with the click of a button—automatically zooming in or out of an image.
